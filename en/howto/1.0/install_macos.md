# How to install Mu on macOS with the Official Installer 

Installing Mu on macOS is super easy.

Mu will run on any machine running macOS version 10.13 High Sierra or later. There is [advice on Apple's website](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201260) on how to check your macOS version.

The following (silent) video demonstrates this process on Mac OS Catalina:

## Step 1 - Download Mu Installer

+ [Download](/en/download) the installer for macOS.

## Step 2 - Open the Installer

+ Open your Downloads folder - click "Go", then "Downloads" on the Finder menu.

  <br/>

When you open the installer you'll be asked to accept the software license
agreement and then your computer will verify the package is not corrupted (this
may take a couple of minutes).

## Step 3 - Install Mu

+ Click, hold and drag the "Mu" icon into the "Applications" folder.

  <br/>
</div>

Press the CTRL button and click on the Mu icon. You'll see a dialog to check
you want to open Mu. Click "Open":

</div>

**This can take some time as OSX checks the Mu package, but you'll only ever have to do it once.**

        <p>Updates to the way OSX works means that when you open Mu for the
        first time you need to tell your operating system that you trust the
        application. The simple solution is to CTRL-click the Mu application
        in your "Applications" folder and then select "Open". If you don't
        you'll just see a warning pop-up (shown in the video at the top of
        this page).</p>

+ Next time you launch Mu you will be able to just double click the Mu icon.
